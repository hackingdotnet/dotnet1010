# Algorithm Workbench 
Draw hierarchy charts or flowcharts that depict the programs described below. 

## Available Credit 
The following steps should be followed in a program that calculates a customer’s available credit: Display the message “Enter the customer’s maximum credit.” 
Wait for the user to enter the customer’s maximum credit. 
Display the message “Enter the amount of credit used by the customer.” 
Wait for the user to enter the customer’s credit used. 
Subtract the used credit from the maximum credit to get the customer’s available credit. 
Display a message that shows the customer’s available credit. 

## Sales Tax 
Design a hierarchy chart or flowchart for a program that calculates the total of a retail sale. 
The program should ask the user for: – 
The retail price of the item being purchased – The sales tax rate Once these items have been entered, the program should calculate and display: – The sales tax for the purchase – The total of the sale
