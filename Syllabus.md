# Computer Science 1010
# Programming Fundamentals 
## Concepts and Methodologies


## Description
This course aligns with the first course in the Computer Science curriculum, CS1, as defined by the joint 
collabortion of the ACM and IEEE.It serves as an introduction to the discipline of computer science with 
a focus on the design and implementation of algorithms to solve simple problems using a high-level 
programming language. This course will use C# (C Sharp).

## Topics:
Fundamental programming constructs, 
problem-solving strategies, 
debugging techniques, 
declaration models, 
overview of procedural and object-oriented 
programming languages
Design, implement, test, and debug algorithms 
use pseudocode and a high-level programming language. 

## Learning Outcomes
Fundamental programming constructs. The building blocks used to construct structured programs.
Using Algorithms: Design and implement algorithms to solve problems 
Discuss general language ideas: 
Grammar, Language, and Syntax and Symantics
Discuss programming-language ideas: 
Recursion, Run Time Stacks
Understand and use variables and types
