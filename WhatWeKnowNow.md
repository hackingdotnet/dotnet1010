# What we know now

The first thing to understand about programming a computer is that, everyone can do it. It may seem difficult or impossible. The key is to remember, yes 
it is difficult but it is not impossible. 

Do you remember the first time you tried to ride a bicycle? Was that difficult? Was it impossible? 
Did you fall? Did you get back up? 
Why?

It is really important to put this into perspective. If you build on what you already know, it becomes easier over time.

## English Class

I am writing in a language called English. We understand that English is the language that use everyday. What we need to consider though, is that there was a time in our lives
when we did not speak or write this language at all and through trial and error, we became more profeccient with our ability to speak, read, and write in the English language. 

We learned that there are 26 letters in the English language and the these letters can have an upper case representation and an lower case representation. Over time we learned how to put a small number of letters together to form simple words like i.e. run, far, walk, and stop

The we put a few of them together to form a simple sentence. i.e. I ran. My dog walks. I seen a stop sign. Then we learned how to put complex sentences together to form or convery 
more information. We began to use puncuatoin and other compoentst that helped the readers of our work to know where a sentence or thought started and stopped. We began to group related sentences together in paragraphs. Then we built many pargraphs together to form an essay or report.


## Learning to Code

You already know everything you need to get started. You know about a simple sentence and a complex sentence. You know that without punctuation it is almost impossible to
understand what is being written.

Programs consist of statements. Statements have puncutation. The rules that govern a lanuage is called syntax. 

## Mathmatical Maturity

Don't run away. I am not talking about Calculus or Linear Algebra. I am trying to describe a level of understanding you need to break down a problem, evaluate it, assess the outcome, and then determine if that outcome is consistent with what you expected.
